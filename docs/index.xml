i wanted to yell, for not understanding, for keeping on putting her own views and opinions on me as they seem the only acceptable ones.</description></item><item><title>essay series - on candle-blower-outers</title><link>https://gizemarici.com/writings/essay-oncandle-blower-outers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gizemarici.com/writings/essay-oncandle-blower-outers/</guid><description>brene brown: where to start? one concept resonating with me at the time was the so-called “candle-blower-outer”, an illustrative life lesson crossing relationships of all kind.
surround yourself with people who will not dim or blow out your light.
pretty straightforward, yet so hard?!
we’ll start from scratch: picture your flame when you’re young — it’s so excited, fragile, shaky, a glistering and joyous beam of light.
as you grow up, you start experimenting — what makes it shine brighter, what fuels it, when does your flame move in such fast motion you want to explode?</description></item><item><title>essay series - on success</title><link>https://gizemarici.com/writings/essay-onsuccess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gizemarici.com/writings/essay-onsuccess/</guid><description>we are trained to succeed.
parents get concerned when their kid takes longer than usual to talk, walk or pee as society has washed our brains to a certain standard.
a force pushing us through school, higher education, work. the urge for success sweeps into our private lives, hobbies, friendships, romantic relationships, marriage, housing, cars and other status symbols.
the list is endless - we host successful parties and dinners, prepare a dish successfully, set the table nicely, succeed in utilising fancy cutlery while remembering in what order to use what fork.</description></item><item><title>event 1</title><link>https://gizemarici.com/activities/event1_tattoevent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gizemarici.com/activities/event1_tattoevent/</guid><description>title: my inner child wants to have tattoos + eat cake

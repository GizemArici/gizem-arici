surround yourself with people who will not dim or blow out your light.
pretty straightforward, yet so hard?!
we’ll start from scratch: picture your flame when you’re young — it’s so excited, fragile, shaky, a glistering and joyous beam of light.
as you grow up, you start experimenting — what makes it shine brighter, what fuels it, when does your flame move in such fast motion you want to explode? and on the contrary, what dims it, what makes it shiver, flicker or even chokes it?
everyday you feel your flame, it’s right there in your chest. it warms you, tints your metaphorical or actual glasses in your favourite colour as you continue to explore yourself and get to know the world around you.
suddenly and without any warning, someone you haven’t seen approaching pours a massive bucket of water on it. your light is dormant now and you’re all cold and wet.
how confusing! you wonder what happened, where to go. you can’t seem to find the road you were walking on anymore. it’s so empty and dark here now.
after a while of wandering around, you shout out loud: WHO DID THIS? No one answers.
a bit later, you discover a loved one with an empty bucket in their hand. weird? you think but you must know — was it you? a silent nod.
you ask them why they did that to you, barely able to see their face as their flame is about to break.
they answer: i love you so much, i only really wanted to protect you. i care. i did what was best for you so you wouldn’t get hurt with your flame so expansive. i didn’t want you to burn yourself. i did it to protect you.
wow, that’s kind you think as you keep going!
someone risking water splashes touching their own tiny flame, giving everything to protect you?! that must be true love.
but then, they also blew you out? your candle looks nothing it did before, you feel crushed.
you try to reignite it, turn it on by many different means, nothing happens. after some time of pondering around, you feel lost. you don’t know anymore what sparked your light in first place, you start feeling angry?
how could that be if your flame was turned off with best intentions from someone who loves you indescribably much?! with time passing, you get tired. a cold you haven’t experienced before sits deep in your bones. where are you?
someone taps you on your shoulder. you see a silhouette holding a light almost explosive so that you’re envious and full of grief for what you’ve lost.
the person holds you by the hand and with a warm smile states i noticed you seemed lost in deep darkness thanks to my candle so bright. my flame is very strong these days, so i thought i could ignite your flame without being left in the dark myself.
kindly, they light your candle and slowly you can feel warmth returning to your bones and body. your soul felt so frosty. a sudden shiver goes through your body as you shake off its tightness.
you thank them wholeheartedly and are now on a mission: finding the person who stopped you from shining in first place.
you need to show and tell them that even though your candle might not look the same anymore, it is shining again and that from now on you will not allow anyone else besides yourself the power to dim it.

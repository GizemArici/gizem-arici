parents get concerned when their kid takes longer than usual to talk, walk or pee as society has washed our brains to a certain standard.
a force pushing us through school, higher education, work. the urge for success sweeps into our private lives, hobbies, friendships, romantic relationships, marriage, housing, cars and other status symbols.

Hi, and welcome to my internet world 🌐

I’m Gizem, a Copenhagen-based creator loving too many things, being impatient learning them.

Still, I get to make objects, paint shapes + colours, write poetry and more to come. 

I can also do some strategy work for you or write very neutral-sounding reports.

Mail me for prices, enquiries, ideas for projects or to say hello.

All paintings can be framed on request and unstretched canvases can be stretched 💪

Stay unserious ☁️

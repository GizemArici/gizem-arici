hi, and welcome to my internet world 🌐

i’m gizem, copenhagen-based, loving too many things, being impatient learning them.

still, i get to make objects, paint shapes + colours, write poetry and host events. 

i can also do some strategy work for you or write very neutral-sounding reports.

mail me for prices, enquiries, ideas for projects or to say hello.

all paintings can be framed on request, unstretched canvases can be stretched 💪

stay unserious ☁️

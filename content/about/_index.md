Hi, and welcome to my internet world 🌐

I’m Gizem, a Copenhagen-based creator loving too many things, being impatient learning them.

Still, I managed and get to make objects, paint shapes + colours, DJ dark music, write poetry and host steamy live drawing sessions.

I can also do some strategy work for you 0r write very neutral-sounding reports.

Mail me for enquiries, ideas for projects or to say hello.

Stay unserious. ☁️

Find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gizisvisible/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gizem-arici-36412310b/) or get in touch via [Mail](mailto:gizem.arici@icloud.com).

we are trained to succeed.

parents get concerned when their kid takes longer than usual to talk, walk or pee as society has washed our brains to a certain standard.

a force pushing us through school, higher education, work. the urge for success sweeps into our private lives, hobbies, friendships, romantic relationships, marriage, housing, cars and other status symbols.

the list is endless - we host successful parties and dinners, prepare a dish successfully, set the table nicely, succeed in utilising fancy cutlery while remembering in what order to use what fork. we track our habits, analyse the quality of our sleep, count calories, steps, and most importantly the money on our bank account.

what the gdp is for a nation, the salary slip is for the citizen. consumers of success, failure and detour are harsh on us. gaps in the cv, repeating a year in school, dropping out, a 360 degree change in career. there will be a need to explain. justification towards employers, family members, society. we’re doomed for success and constant growth which we constantly fail.

we can discuss this with intellect, data and statistics but the felt reality, divide and exploitation may hit the harshest. by choice, current systems hit those the hardest that don’t fit into the one-size-fits-all success scheme that is imposed upon us because of your accent, your hijab, your skin colour, your not so highly ranked university, your poorness, your disability, your fatness, your smallness, your gender identification and what not.

but, our parents and society want the best for us (lol). but really, who benefits from you not benefiting. in most cases, it will be the system. so vague yet so simple. people in power remain their power by oppressing those with less power and that power is nowhere close of being distributed fairly.

so, do i want to have success in a system that is built to crash me. i don’t think so. all the years of climbing the latter really mean nothing if you don’t agree with the definition of success (google succeed).

many very smart people already wrote about why we must stop measuring a country’s wealth by its gdp so maybe we should also stop defining personal success by the fullness of our pocket, the busyness of our schedule or by the title we hold.

i wish success could be measured by how relaxed i am and not by how hard i can push.

swallow me, swallow me ⁣
lay my body down ⁣
far down ⁣
the further - force me ⁣
forced me ⁣
each cell, slow, slow, slow ⁣
i watch through your gaze ⁣
and through your gaze only ⁣
the way you look at me - ⁣
you swallowed me ⁣
blindfolded to recognise this flesh ⁣
irreversible, the black ⁣
a curtain of protection ⁣
silencing, to complete obeyance⁣
touching my ✨ as if it wasn’t yours to fetishise ⁣
for this is not for your hardness ⁣
but for my lust ⁣
strangling your desire⁣
to control ⁣
what was never yours to claim

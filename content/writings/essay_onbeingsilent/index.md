title: "essay series - on being silent"

three weeks prior to reading your silence will not protect you i had a phone call where i decided to break some of the countless silences. i can recall the frost in my bones + how i couldn’t stop talking, intervening, with an almost shivering voice. patiently, i could barely not interrupt — i hadn’t raised my voice for too long. 

i wanted to yell, for not understanding, for keeping on putting her own views and opinions on me as they seem the only acceptable ones. i wanted to be heard, listened to, taken in. oftentimes, when i tried to convince her of things different to what they had grown up with, resistance was the answer. many fights were fought to my favour: going out with friends, staying out late, partying, holiday without them, a german boyfriend, sleeping at his place. 

now, all these sprinkles of freedom are turned against me: too much freedom, too much looseness, too little control, too little homebound, too little of a “hanim” serving tea. initial regret of letting me move away, regret of letting me study here and there, regret of having given those freedoms, because now i posted an almost nude on instagram. a disaster as big as a natural catastrophe for the family. to be blamed and shamed for is not only me but my parents, for letting it go this far, for not following the tradition. pressure on my dad for not having been *that* turkish dad in my upbringing, for letting me experiment and play, for trying to shelter me from high expectations thrown at me. until to date, a positive attribute of his character, might as well be turned against him, now that i’ve lost my mind and gotten out of control. now that i am officially and publicly insane.

i remember long time ago, my cousin went on a trip with her partner while they were not married yet. today, they are and have a child too. she came home from that trip and during her absence it was all that was talked about. she came back and was put into place (not violently). i shall be careful though, not getting any wrong ideas. she might have bad influence on me.

it makes me remember the women who got married, wearing a red band around their waistline during the wedding celebration, symbolising their (eventual) virginity to everyone that evening. how degrading, how empty of a symbol. my female worth tied to my tight vagina.

winding way back in time, i kept being praised *good* , praised for my manners and put together behaviour. as a baby and toddler, i wasn’t crying much. as a child, i wasn’t yelling around or crying often. in the years to come, i’ve been a straight-a-student (with some exceptions), all teachers’ + adults’ darling for not being too much, for having little demands, for being calm, for being a chameleon, for being pleasant, for being kind, for being patient, for being understanding, for not making too much noise, for being well-behaved. it doesn’t mean, i didn’t express myself at all but i knew how to read my surroundings and how much of me i could be in what surrounding. a character for each group or individual i spent time with. i was silenced, yet I censor myself.

there was a lot of love in the home i grew up in, equally it was a distressed environment. no encouragement to talk about what was going on in the family with anyone outside. drawing comics, they were found, destroyed and forbidden. exploring my sexuality, i was told off to. listening to linkin park day in and day out. it was not appreciated, it was to be stopped, if possible. why couldn’t i just listen to the charts? whenever, i tried to release *negative* emotions, the output was not the *right one*. bottle in, bottle in, bottle in. at the same time being asked to share my feelings. how confusing while i was trying to express and feel them my way.

while i was trying to keep having you a part of my life, to call from time to time, to not focus on your flaws, to accept that certain things won’t change, to accept you would always pity my *poor* cousin because he was gay, to not take it personally you said it was disgusting if i were with a woman. all that judgement, all that fear, all the unknown, all the double morality. you positioned yourself the highest judge. the career you always wanted to have but never pursued. i kept performing what you needed me to be.

your moral standards seem to be the only truth to you.

yes, my silence did not protect me, it made me sick. it bound me to bed. it hurt my body and it still does until one day it won’t.

did you ever ask yourself, why i am this silent? why you don’t know much about me? why i haven’t been interested in sitting with you, drinking tea, gossiping and judging everything that is alien to you. whenever, i tried to put forward different realities, i was met with you will understand when you’re older, you don’t know any better, you will stop saying these stupid things one day, how would you know or a simple ahhh, ohhh, head shaking, a shocked face. trying to talk to a generation whose first concern can be what the neighbours think. standing up for myself again and again, I needed to argue for my diagnosed PTSD to be real, to not be a cause of my working hours. that’s a different kind of story, still its roots are familiar.

for some time, i haven’t felt this homeless before. i also haven’t felt this liberated before.
silently, would i disappear: from your reality into my dreams. from my own judgment into stagnation. from fear into stillness. from expectations to be frozen. into pain and endless spirals, into not believing, into doubting.

into believing anything is too much while everything is too little.

how much more power am i to give them, how much longer am i in their dictatorship.
